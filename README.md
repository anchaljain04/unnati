# Unnati - A Service Provider

## Final Year Project

## Unnati - A Service Provider is an app for connecting the local venders and the customers.

The project focuses on developing a system that presents a cross-platform for the customers to find the pople for their day to day work and for the local vendors to find the work easily.

The primary objective of this web portal is to provide various opportunities to general handymen and domestic workers to earn their livelihood in a managed manner. This system also helps the people who are in need of these services.

It has been observed that many a times the vendors/service providers are not given wages according to their skills or the inflation on the other side sometimes the customers do not get the house helps according to their need and many times unknowingly result in paying more money as they do not know other service providers in their locality. From there disadvantages, there is a need for a linkage between them so as to work efficiently. For the customers, they can quickly search for the help they need, if it is available or not.
